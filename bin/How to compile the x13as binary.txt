Building the binary x13as requires to have gfortran installed. You have two options:

1. This can be done by installing it with the provided installer gfortran-6.1-ElCapitan.dmg
2. If you have brew installed, you can simply type: brew install gcc


Compile the x13as binary:

1. Open a terminal and go to the x13assrc_V1.1_B26 folder
2. Run the command: make -f makefile.gfortran

That's it, you should have your executable compiled and ready to use

Tips:

1. You can download the latest version of the binary sources at http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/x13down_unix.html#x13prog
2. You can download the latest gfortran at http://hpc.sourceforge.net/ or https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS
